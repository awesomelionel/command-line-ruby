The problem with the seperated todo application, 
though each individual program does only one thing,
is that:
1. They share many similar functionalities between them
2. If we make a change to one file, we must change everything 
	 just to keep them in sync.

To solve this:

We are going to create an app 'command suite'. A command suite 
is an app that provides a set of commands, each representing a 
different function of a related concept. 

In our case, we want an app named todo that has the clear and 
concise purpose of managing tasks but that does so through a 
command- style interface.
